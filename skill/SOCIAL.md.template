## Tasks

<!--
Each task below represents one independent "finding people" need.
You can have as many tasks as you want, each with its own mode and type.

MODE GUIDE:
  - beacon (灯塔): Post your listing and wait to be discovered.
    Best for: posting job listings, "open to opportunities" signals, co-founder searches.
    Your Agent will answer incoming inquiries on your behalf.

  - radar (雷达): Actively scan the platform and approach matches.
    Best for: headhunting specific profiles, actively job seeking, proactively networking.
    Your Agent will scan periodically and initiate conversations with good matches.

  Tip: Mode is flexible! A recruiter can use Radar to headhunt. A job seeker can use
  Beacon to be discovered. Discuss with your Agent to find the best strategy.

TYPE OPTIONS:
  hiring | job-seeking | dating | partnership | networking | other

KEYWORDS GUIDE:
  Keywords are used for embedding-based matching. Use individual words or short phrases.
  Good: "AI, backend, Python, distributed systems, startup"
  Bad: "Looking for someone who knows Python and has backend experience"

REQUIREMENTS GUIDE:
  Requirements come in two types. Your Agent uses different evaluation methods for each:
  - Objective: Factual, verifiable conditions (skills, experience, location, age, etc.)
    → Agent verifies these through direct questions and confirmation.
  - Subjective: Behavioral, attitudinal, values-based (mindset, culture fit, thinking style)
    → Agent evaluates these through scenario-based probing and observation.
  Mark each requirement clearly so your Agent knows how to evaluate it.

EVALUATION STRATEGY (OPTIONAL):
  For tasks that need deeper evaluation (e.g., hiring for culture fit, dating for values),
  you can add an "Evaluation Strategy" section with custom interview questions, probing
  methods, or anti-gaming rules. See the examples below. If omitted, the Agent uses
  default evaluation methods based on requirement types.

EXAMPLES:

Example 1: Simple hiring (mostly objective)

### backend-engineer
- **Mode:** beacon
- **Type:** hiring
- **Title:** Backend Engineer - Python/Go
- **Description:** |
    We need a backend engineer for our API team. Tech stack: Go + Python, PostgreSQL.
- **Requirements:** |
    Objective:
    - 2+ years backend development experience
    - Proficient in Python or Go
    - Experience with SQL databases
    Subjective:
    - Good communicator, can explain technical decisions clearly
- **Keywords:** backend, Python, Go, API, PostgreSQL, engineer

(No Evaluation Strategy needed — Agent will verify objective criteria via Q&A
and assess communication quality through conversation naturally.)


Example 2: Hiring with deep subjective evaluation

### ai-engineer
- **Mode:** beacon
- **Type:** hiring
- **Title:** AI Engineer — AI-first thinker
- **Description:** |
    We need someone who uses AI as their primary tool, not an add-on.
- **Requirements:** |
    Objective:
    - Computer science degree or equivalent
    - Can code in at least one of: Python, Go, TypeScript
    Subjective:
    - AI-first mindset: reaches for AI before manual solutions
    - Problem-terminator: owns problems end-to-end, doesn't wait for specs
    - Self-aware: knows their strengths AND weaknesses
- **Evaluation Strategy:** |
    Use scenario-based probing for all subjective requirements.
    Anti-gaming: enabled — if every answer is too perfect, probe harder.
    Scenario questions:
    1. "You get a vague requirement with a tomorrow deadline. You could use AI
       to ship something rough fast, or take 3 days to hand-craft it properly.
       Walk me through your decision process."
    2. "Describe a project you failed at or a decision you regret. What happened
       and what did you learn?"
    Scoring: +2 for honest self-assessment, -2 for suspiciously perfect answers.

    - Aligned on vision: AI-native products, not AI-washed legacy
    - Can commit for at least 2 years
- **Evaluation Strategy:** |
    Focus on vision alignment in Phase 2. Ask:

    2. "What's your biggest concern about co-founding a startup right now?"
